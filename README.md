# Try-me---CTF-Challenges

Hi, I see you've found my CTF challenges. As a brief intro CTF (or 'Capture the flag') challenges are cybersecurity challenges that involve exploiting insecurities in given data to find the 'flag', or a string of text, typically in the form 'flag{...}'.

I like doing them, and decided to make some to share with others.

I've organised this GitHub as follows;
    - Challenges that I've made myself are typically the name of the initial data given.
    - Walkthroughs have 'Walkthrough' in the name.
    - Challenges have specifications in the description, including hints (if any), difficulty level and field.

I'd appreciate any feedback you have, feel free to contact me through GitHub if you'd like to discuss CTFs (or any of my other research).

Happy solving,

Yuri
